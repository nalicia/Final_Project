Storms initially developed over the high terrain of northern and eastern Arizona as well as near the Table Top mesa area south of Phoenix. High DCAPE promoted strong thunderstorm downbursts. The downbursts generated outflows that progressed into the greater Phoenix metro area and led to the development of additional scattered thunderstorm. The thunderstorms in the metro area produced damaging winds that led to numerous downed trees, downed power poles, and other property damage. The storms were also nearly stationary, under weak steering flow, and produced very heavy rainfall with rain rates around 1.5-2.0 inches per hour and briefly higher in the strongest storms. This led to considerable flash flooding around Phoenix with several road closure and significant flow in major washes. Even after the strongest storms in Phoenix subsided in the late evening of the 22nd, areas of moderate to heavy rain continued from northeast to southwest through the night and through mid-afternoon on the 23rd. The continued rain through the 23rd was aided by a strengthening diffluent flow regime between the monsoon high to the north and a retrograding upper low moving west through New Mexico.

Two to more than three inches of rain was measured at Cane Creek State Park (Lincoln County), Fordyce (Dallas County), Monticello (Drew County), Nashville (Howard County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County). Several roads were under water between Avilla (Saline County) and Ferndale (Pulaski County), and also at Monticello (Drew County).||During the predawn hours of the 7th, thunderstorm winds downed a tree on Highway 53 just south of Gurdon (Clark County). This caused a log truck to overturn. In the afternoon, more trees were toppled in Camden and East Camden (both in Ouachita County). A chapel roof was damaged just southwest of Cummins (Lincoln County), and part of a roof was blown off close to Sorrells (Jefferson County).||At least a dozen Tornado Warnings were issued in portions of Calhoun, Clark, Cleveland, Dallas, Garland, Hot Spring, Montgomery, Ouachita, and Pike Counties. A funnel cloud was spotted by law enforcement at Gum Springs (Clark County). There was a brief tornado reported (rated EFU, where U is unknown because there was no damage to evaluate) to the west of Calion (Union County) at 426 pm CDT. The tornado apparently did little more than kick up some dust.||On the 8th, there was a life threatening deluge in southeast Arkansas. Showers and thunderstorms became widespread, and moved over the same areas for several hours.||Too much rain flooded roads at Star City and Varner (both in Lincoln County), Pine Bluff (Jefferson County), Stuttgart (Arkansas County), and also at Dumas and McGehee (both in Desha County). Water got into many homes. Crop and road damage (washouts) was reported in Bradley County. A creek was out of its banks just southeast of Timber Ridge (Pulaski County).||There was high water along Highway 114 between Calmer and Rison (both in Cleveland County), Highway 425 near Yorktown (Lincoln County), Highway 293 east of Garrett Bridge (Lincoln County), Highway 46 not far from Ebb (Grant County), Highway 276 on the south side of Stuttgart (Arkansas County), and Highway 1 at Kelso (Desha County). These highways were eventually closed temporarily.||The situation was the most serious in Desha and Drew Counties, and a Flash Flood Emergency was issued for the communities of Dumas, Pickens, Rohwer (all in Desha County), and Winchester (Drew County) at 1142 am CDT on the 8th. Radar estimated 10 to more than 15 inches of rain, and there was water everywhere. Some folks indicated (through social media) they had never witnessed flooding of this magnitude.||From an historic perspective, Rohwer (Desha County) received 9.25 inches of rain in the twenty four hour period ending at 700 am CDT on the 8th. This was the most rain in one day at the site, and the fourth largest one day total across the state in June. If that was not enough, 9.97 inches of liquid was measured the next day! Adding the numbers, the whopping 19.22 inches on the 8th/9th was the second biggest two day amount in Arkansas. It was just behind the 21.45 inches at Danville (Yell County) on December 3-4, 1982.||Relentless cloudbursts continued to start the 9th in eastern Arkansas. A rain gauge near DeValls Bluff (Prairie County) completely filled (to six inches) between 400 am and 700 am CST. Buildings were flooded and cars were stalled in Clarendon (Monroe County). It was the same story in Humnoke (Lonoke County), and sandbags were ordered to stop the water.||It was just getting worse in Stuttgart (Arkansas County), with one picture showing more water in a home than ever before (in the life of the photographer/42 years). That claim was likely true because the 7.50 inches of rain that caused the problem easily surpassed the previous one day June record of 4.07 inches on the 29th in 1939. At least fifteen homes were impacted by flooding at Altheimer (Jefferson County). Highway 302 from Highway 17 to Highway 79 was shut down in Monroe County, as was Highway 15 near Sherrill (Jefferson County), Highway 33 east of Tollville (Prairie County), and Highways 85 and 318 near Oneida (Phillips County).||As the weather calmed down in the east by the afternoon of the 9th, temperatures warmed well into the 80s to around 90 degrees across the northern and central counties. Heating and lots of humidity were enough to fuel isolated strong to severe storms toward evening.||Just after 700 pm CDT, a video showed a tornado (rated EFU) that lasted two minutes in a field near Blakemore (Lonoke County). Between 700 pm and 800 pm CDT, there was quarter size hail just east of College Station (Pulaski County). Little Rock (Pulaski County) got a quick 1.10 inches of rain. Trees were blown down at Cave City (Sharp County). At 805 pm CDT, there was a brief weak tornado (rated EF0) a few miles southeast of England (Lonoke County).||The focus shifted back to the southeast early on the 10th. You guessed it...the sky was falling again. Rain plus runoff from the soaking on the 8th/9th in northern and central Desha County inundated farms toward Halley (Desha County) in the south. At 200 pm CDT, an irrigation canal east of Pickens (Desha County) was breached, and adjacent farmland became a lake. The canal was patched by evening. At Florence (Drew County), residents were forced to use boats to get around. Water threatened structures at Dermott and Eudora (both in Chicot County), and sandbagging was in progress. It was clear that assistance was needed, and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency. ||All was quiet quiet in Little Rock (Pulaski County) on the 10th, and the sun was out. For the first time in 2021, the temperature touched 90 degrees (the high was 92 degrees), and it was three weeks late (it normally happens by May 18th). Toward evening, it got loud toward Pinnacle Mountain (Pulaski County). A severe storm pumped out quarter size hail, winds strong enough to push over a few trees, and up to six inches of rain in less than two hours.

The MCS produced widespread strong winds with localized damaging winds from individual microbursts across the region. The strong winds also generated dense blowing dust in southwest Arizona. In addition to the wind, storms were producing average rain rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour with briefly higher rates in the strongest cells. This led to flash flooding in multiple areas.

FCDMC gages on Sand Tank Wash, Bender Wash, and in the Maricopa Mountains measured rainfall amounts around 3 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours for an annual exceedance probability of 0.1%. FCDMC found the most significant floodwaters were within Sand Tank Wash, with lesser flows in Bender and Scott Avenue Washes. The NWS Phoenix survey found evidence of out of bank flooding in Sand Tank Wash 1 to 3 miles south of Interstate-8 (I-8) with 2 to 6 feet of water and sizable debris. The streamflow gage on Sand Tank Wash at I-8 reached alarm stage at 0157MST, bank full at 0341MST, and flood stage at 0352MST. The gage crested at 7.69 feet with 5000 cfs of flow at 0408MST.

High winds were also a threat, as two severe thunderstorm warnings were issued, and numerous reports of wind damage were obtained. There was even enough low level rotation in one storm to constitute a tornado warning during the early morning hours on the 30th.

Within the hardest-hit southern counties (mainly Furnas/Harlan/Franklin) there were several instances of not only severe-criteria wind/hail but also narrow swaths of very heavy rain and localized flash flooding...resulting from the highest official/measured short-fuse rain totals of the 2021 convective season within the 24-county local area. On the hail/wind side of things, a few of the more notable reports (all occurring between 5:30-11:30 p.m. CDT) included: golf ball size hail in rural northwestern Buffalo County; ping pong ball size stones near Wilsonville; several instances of estimated or measured gusts of 60-70 MPH within Furnas/Harlan counties (including a few downed trees in towns such as Alma/Orleans). However, for parts of primarily Furnas, Harlan, Franklin and Webster counties, this event's signature calling card was heavy rain and localized flooding. While the majority of those four counties received modest amounts of no more than 1-2 inches, significant training of storms dumped notably higher totals between 3-7+ in narrow swaths over the course of 6-8 hours. The most significant of these heavy rain bullseyes focused along/near the Highway 136 corridor between Orleans and Oxford, where 5-7+ was common, including an unofficial automated sensor that tallied 7.13 and nearby CoCoRaHS reports of 6.22 and 6.16. Although ground-truth reports of impactful flooding/flash flooding were sparse, a resident six miles north-northwest of Orleans confirmed that School Creek spilled out of its banks overnight, inundating a nearby gravel road for several hours and encroaching within 50 feet of his home. Despite this concentrated batch of very heavy rain falling directly onto the Republican River basin, there was no firm evidence that the Republican itself flooded before excess water flushed out into Harlan County Lake. Outside of this most notable heavy rain bullseye, other impressive area rain totals included 4.76 in Alma and 3.90 near Franklin. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing within South Central Nebraska: things got underway between 5-6 p.m. CDT as a large severe storm infiltrated southern Furnas County after initiating a bit earlier just west of the local area. During the same hour, another severe cell fired up slightly to its east over the Furnas/Harlan County line. Between 6-7 p.m. CDT these two storms merged over Harlan County before drifting slowly east across southern Franklin/Webster counties between 7-9 p.m. CDT. Meanwhile, during this same 7-9 p.m. CDT time frame but roughly 50-80 miles to the north-northeast, a separate area of scattered strong to severe activity briefly blossomed, primarily affecting parts of Buffalo, Sherman and Howard counties (and yielding a few hail reports) before fading away. Getting back to the original southern convection, the main concerns gradually transitioned from hail/wind to hydro/flooding between 9 p.m. and midnight CDT as a persistent, west-east oriented corridor of cell training focused along a line from Furnas through Webster counties (likely as a strengthening low level jet impinged upon the outflow/cold pool trailing from the earlier-evening storms). By midnight CDT this west-east corridor of training convection had thankfully lifted slightly north of its original position (more so along a line from Gosper through Kearney counties), ending the heavy rain threat for the night in the aforementioned places that had already been swamped with impressive amounts. Post-midnight, storms continued to percolate within portions of primarily Gosper/Phelps/Kearney/Webster/Nuckolls counties for a few to several more hours, but this activity was less intense and a bit more transient than the earlier round, keeping heavy rain and flooding concerns in check. By 5 a.m. CDT, the areal coverage of activity within southern local counties had waned considerably, with the last strong storm of the night affecting Nuckolls County before mostly-dissipating by sunrise. In the mid-upper levels, South Central Nebraska received a glancing blow of lift from a compact-but-potent shortwave trough swinging east-northeast from the Dakotas toward northern MN/southern Canada during the afternoon-evening. At the surface, the local area resided within a broad warm sector, slightly east-southeast of a weak cold front stalling out over western/north central Nebraska, and hundreds of miles south of a strong low pressure system (around 998 millibars) centered over southern Manitoba during the evening-overnight. Closer to home, the late afternoon initiation of robust storms near the Furnas County area was likely aided by modest moisture convergence focused slightly northeast of a secondary/weaker surface low (around 1004 millibars) along the CO/KS border. All in all, the mesoscale environment proved rather supportive of severe storms and transient supercell structures, with late afternoon parameters featuring 2000-3000 J/kg mixed layer CAPE and around 40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.","Radar estimates and local mesonet/CoCoRaHS stations confirmed a corridor of rainfall amounts from 4 to over 7 inches across this Flash Flood Warning area. The highest measured rainfall amount was 7.13 inches, recorded by a mesonet station located six miles east-southeast of Oxford, with most of this rain falling between 8-11 p.m. CDT.  A resident located six miles north-northwest of Orleans reported that School Creek flooded and covered at least one gravel road during the early morning hours...with water getting within 50 feet of his home. The initially-issued Flash Flood Warning was replaced by an Areal Flood Warning that lasted several more hours, as water gradually receded through the morning.",CSV

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th.||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range.||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.",Very heavy rainfall with 2 inch per hour rain rates fell over very saturated conditions and resulted in additional flash flooding.

Storms initially developed over the high terrain of northern and eastern Arizona as well as near the Table Top mesa area south of Phoenix. High DCAPE promoted strong thunderstorm downbursts. The downbursts generated outflows that progressed into the greater Phoenix metro area and led to the development of additional scattered thunderstorm. The thunderstorms in the metro area produced damaging winds that led to numerous downed trees, downed power poles, and other property damage. The storms were also nearly stationary, under weak steering flow, and produced very heavy rainfall with rain rates around 1.5-2.0 inches per hour and briefly higher in the strongest storms. This led to considerable flash flooding around Phoenix with several road closure and significant flow in major washes. Even after the strongest storms in Phoenix subsided in the late evening of the 22nd, areas of moderate to heavy rain continued from northeast to southwest through the night and through mid-afternoon on the 23rd. The continued rain through the 23rd was aided by a strengthening diffluent flow regime between the monsoon high to the north and a retrograding upper low moving west through New Mexico. Additional significant flash flooding was observed on the 23rd, mostly in the foothills north of the Phoenix metro, with many road closures, flowing washes and creeks, and some water rescues.",The Thunderbird Road underpass at Interstate-17 became impassable with 2 to 3 feet of standing water after over 1 inch of rain fell in roughly one hour.

Numerous periods of heavy rain occurred during this period, which in turn resulted in widespread and sustained river flooding, urban and small stream flooding, mudslides, and landslides in addition to the significant and widespread impacts from high winds, pounding surf, and coastal flooding.||During the wettest portion of this 19-day period, Washington State experienced widespread precipitation totals between 200% and 350% of normal. The prolonged bouts of moderate to heavy rain between January 10 and 16, 2021, resulted in 12 major rivers exceeding flood stage, 3 of them exceeded moderate flood.",The Chehalis River near Grand Mound and Skookumchuck River near Bucoda crested above moderate flood.

The disturbance rotated eastward near St. Louis, Missouri just ahead of a cold front. The soil across southern Illinois was saturated from an early morning round of thunderstorms. Runoff from the afternoon storms caused very large rises on area creeks, mainly north of a line from Carbondale to Harrisburg. One fatality was associated with record flooding of Rayse Creek near Mount Vernon.","Several streets on the south side of Mt. Vernon had standing water over them.

Additionally, much of this region had seen 300%+ of average rainfall over the preceding few weeks. This caused soil moisture values and streamflow conditions to be well above average.  Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall produced significant flash flooding in southern New Hampshire. Reports to the weather service included totals of nearly 7 inches of rain in Jaffrey, 5 inches in Marlborough and Swanzey, and between 2 and 3 inches in Chesterfield. ||Severe flooding prompted numerous local emergency operations centers to open, and washed out road infrastructure in 14 communities in the Monadnock Region. Early estimates from state and local damages verified at over $2 million from the storm.

The river flooded Carlton Road and Old Richmond Rd in Swanzey. Three residents had to be water rescued. Further downstream in Winchester the flood waters inundated a solar field that was under construction causing great damage to the equipment. The Town library and VFW also flooded from the river. Forest Lake Dam was overtopped and sandbagged. Several properties along Warwick Road were flooded as backwater from the Mirey Brook, a tributary to the Ashuelot River, came out of its banks.

This impacted the northern inner channels with 24 to 36 hours of heavy precipitation from a deep upper level trough with a long fetch transporting a significant amount of precipitable water over the complex terrain of the Alaska panhandle. ||This atmospheric river produced very high freezing level with very warm air going all the way up to 14,000 feet. The warm rain melted snow that was left from the previous winter in the mountains along with ice melt from area glaciers to increase runoff into the Taiya and Mendenhall River drainage basins.

Two storms produced tornadoes that remained on the ground for significant distances. The  tornado that moved through Fredericktown, MO, passing through Madison County into Perry County, was on the ground for 18.9 miles. Another tornado moved from St. Francois County through St. Genevieve County in Missouri into Randolph County in Illinois, staying on the ground for over 40 miles.","The tornado moved out of Missouri (Ste. Genevieve County) into Illinois (Randolph County) moving though flood plains and crossing the Mississippi River just north of the Menard Correctional Center.  The tornado crossed Route 3 south of Lochhead Drive destroying a small barn, snapping or uprooting trees, and caused minor damage to several homes and a hardware store. Snapped or uprooted trees and downed power poles were found along the remainder of the tornado track through Chester with roof damage to several homes on Brenda Street. The worst damage in Chester occurred just northeast of the Palestine Road and Three Spring Roads intersection, where two farm outbuildings were completely destroyed. The larger of the two buildings was well-built with anchor bolts every 18-24 inches in the concrete foundation. This damage was rated EF-2. Further northeast, minor roof damage and the loss of the roof-mounted HVAC unit was found at the nursing home near Old Lodge Lane and Three Springs Road. The tornado continued to the northeast into Bremen paralleling and crossing Route 150, producing tree damage and minor roof damage to several homes. Minor roof damage to several homes, damage to several farm outbuildings, and snapped and uprooted trees were found along parts of Chester Road and Paradise Road. The worst of this damage was rated EF-1. The tornado dissipated around 1.6 miles northeast of Bremen, just west of Route 150.",CSV

The tornado occurred in a large cluster of storms that were generally moving east across Fayette County. There were multiple mid-level circulations evident on radar during this event.  So while a single tornado path has been created, there may have been other smaller satellite tornadoes or vortices that caused minor wind damage in other areas of Fayette County that evening.

A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down in extreme northeast Adams County south of Trumbull, crossed through far northwest Clay County before heading into southwest Hamilton County.

There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down in extreme northeast Adams County south of Trumbull, crossed through far northwest Clay County before heading into southwest Hamilton County. This intermittent tornado damaged a horse barn south of Trumbull as it began its roughly seven-mile path. As it moved northeast, most of the observable damage was to a couple of irrigation pivots along with a snapped tree. The estimated maximum wind gust was 75 MPH.",CSV

Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles.

It featured the first-ever December derecho observed anywhere in the United States and the first Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the NWS Storm Prediction Center in December for Iowa. Unofficially, it set the new single-day Iowa records for the most tornadoes and the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes since 1950.  Finally, it will break the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa. ||Tornadoes: There were 63 confirmed tornadoes that occurred in Iowa, 21 of which were rated EF-2. Sixty three is unofficially the most tornadoes in Iowa in a single day with the previous being 35 tornadoes on August 31, 2014. Further, 21 EF-2 tornadoes is unofficially the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes in a single day with the previous being 16 tornadoes on June 7, 1984.

During the event, nearly the entire state of Iowa was under a Severe Thunderstorm Warning at some point.  Audubon reported the highest gust in Iowa at 88 mph. This storm also met the criteria for a ���derecho'', which makes it the first derecho on record in the month of December anywhere in the United States.  Finally, we had an unofficial gust of 108 mph recorded by a mesonet station near Sheffield, Iowa associated with one of the tornadic circulations. ||Environmental Wind: After the line of storms had passed, numerous strong, non-thunderstorm wind gusts over 70 mph occurred overnight. The top three non-thunderstorm wind gusts were 83 mph in Decatur City, 81 mph in Marshalltown, and 80 mph in Johnston. The Des Moines International Airport recorded a 74 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust, which is the highest non-thunderstorm wind gust at this location since 1970.| |Temperatures: In addition to the severe weather and strong non-thunderstorm winds, the temperatures were remarkable and record setting.

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado started in Kearney County north of Minden and crossed into Buffalo County, lifting near Gibbon. This tornado was typical for the day, likely intermittent with regard to ground circulation and impacting rural areas. Much of the path damage can be traced to center irrigation pivots either partially or fully overturned. The tornado damaged a couple power poles and peeled back some roofing material at the Rowe Sanctuary. A measured wind gust 83 MPH was recorded at the sanctuary as the storm passed. Damage was a bit sparse north of the river. The tornadic circulation likely crossed Interstate 80 about three miles west of the Gibbon interchange before knocking over a couple more pivots and lifting just southwest of Gibbon. The maximum estimated speed of 85 MPH was based upon the measured wind gust at the sanctuary and damage to nearby power poles.",CSV

The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down just inside Franklin County south of Campbell, moved through northwestern Webster County and into southern Adams County. As this tornado tracked northeast, some power poles, and irrigation pivot, and an outbuilding were damaged east of Campbell. Once it crossed into Adams County, a few more pivots were tipped and a home sustained minor damage. The maximum wind gust was estimated to be 85 MPH.",CSV

As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This shorter path tornado started east of Lowell in Kearney County and traveled north-northeast across the Platte River into Buffalo County. Damage was sparse, but a few center irrigation pivots and minor tree damage was found. The tornadic circulation likely crossed Interstate 80 about 2.5 miles west of the Shelton interchange. The tornado moved across one farmstead where a garage was completely destroyed. Minor tree damage was also noted. The damage to the garage was the primary basis for the 80 MPH maximum wind speed estimate. The tornado tipped one more pivot before lifting just northeast of the farmstead.",CSV

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado is a continuation of the tornado that touched down east of Lowell in Kearney County and traveled north-northeast across the Platte River into Buffalo County, lifting near Shelton. Damage was sparse, but a few center irrigation pivots and minor tree damage was found. The tornadic circulation likely crossed Interstate 80 about 2.5 miles west of the Shelton interchange. The tornado moved across one farmstead where a garage was completely destroyed. Minor tree damage was also noted. The damage to the garage was the primary basis for the 80 MPH maximum wind speed estimate. The tornado tipped one more pivot before lifting just northeast of the farmstead.",CSV

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down in Webster County and lifted north into Adams County. This intermittent tornado path started west of Blue Hill, with damage including some irrigation pipe strewn into a tree line, and some tree damage a few miles west of town.

The highest recorded wind gusts were 85 mph in Plainview (Wabasha County), 84 mph in Harmony (Fillmore County) and Mabel (Fillmore County) and 83 mph south of Grand Meadow (Mower County). A state of emergency was declared in Fillmore County. The Governor of Minnesota authorized emergency assistance for the following counties: Dodge, Fillmore, Houston, Mower, Olmsted and Wabasha.",This was the fourth tornado of the night in Fillmore County. This EF1 tornado formed just south of the tiny town of Arendahl and was only on the ground for one minute as it moved rapidly northeast.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down in far northeastern Adams County and continued into far southeastern Hall County. This tornado impacted three farmsteads. The maximum wind speed estimate of 100 MPH was based upon the collapse of an outbuilding at one farmstead. Partial roof loss was noted at one home, while another home had some superficial damage. Similar to other tornadoes, more irrigation pivots were overturned. The tornadic circulation probably crossed Highway 281 near the fuel supply facility south of Doniphan before lifting a mile or so south of Doniphan.

It featured the first-ever December derecho observed anywhere in the United States and the first Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the NWS Storm Prediction Center in December for Iowa. Unofficially, it set the new single-day Iowa records for the most tornadoes and the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes since 1950.  Finally, it will break the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa. ||Tornadoes: There were 63 confirmed tornadoes that occurred in Iowa, 21 of which were rated EF-2. Sixty three is unofficially the most tornadoes in Iowa in a single day with the previous being 35 tornadoes on August 31, 2014. Further, 21 EF-2 tornadoes is unofficially the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes in a single day with the previous being 16 tornadoes on June 7, 1984.

During the event, nearly the entire state of Iowa was under a Severe Thunderstorm Warning at some point.  Audubon reported the highest gust in Iowa at 88 mph. This storm also met the criteria for a ���derecho'', which makes it the first derecho on record in the month of December anywhere in the United States.  Finally, we had an unofficial gust of 108 mph recorded by a mesonet station near Sheffield, Iowa associated with one of the tornadic circulations. ||Environmental Wind: After the line of storms had passed, numerous strong, non-thunderstorm wind gusts over 70 mph occurred overnight. The top three non-thunderstorm wind gusts were 83 mph in Decatur City, 81 mph in Marshalltown, and 80 mph in Johnston. The Des Moines International Airport recorded a 74 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust, which is the highest non-thunderstorm wind gust at this location since 1970.| |Temperatures: In addition to the severe weather and strong non-thunderstorm winds, the temperatures were remarkable and record setting. Numerous record daily highs were broken by many degrees. In addition and preliminarily, the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa of 74 degrees that was set in Thurman, IA on December 6, 1939 was broken with four sites reaching 75 degrees (Oskaloosa, Muscatine, Iowa City, and Ottumwa).||For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Sioux Falls, NWS Omaha, NWS Wichita, NWS Pueblo, NWS Twin Cities, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Hastings, NWS La Crosse, NWS Green Bay, or NWS Milwaukee.",Tornado developed northwest of Lewis and moved rapidly to the northeast.

In fact, the nearly continuous swath of damaging winds that stretched from south central NE/north central KS northeastward into southeast MN/western WI was officially declared a serial derecho...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Including nine confirmed tornadoes in South Central Nebraska (and 19 others that occurred in eastern NE), there were 28 confirmed tornadoes within the state...a remarkable fact considering that prior to this day only five Nebraska tornadoes had occurred in December since 1950! Focusing exclusively on the local South Central NE area going forward, the nine tornadoes consisted of five rated EF-1 and four rated EF-0. There were also dozens of measured reports of damaging winds in the 60-80+ MPH range (both thunderstorm/non-thunderstorm), including a peak thunderstorm gust of 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island and a peak non-thunderstorm gust of 77 MPH by an unofficial mesonet in southwestern Clay County. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, despite countless instances of damage primarily to irrigation pivots, outbuildings, power lines/poles and trees. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 35-50 MPH as temperatures soared into the mid-60s to low-70s F (setting new Dec. 15th records in Grand Island/Hastings), accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F (mainly near/east of Highway 281). This set the stage for severe convection/tornadoes during the early-mid afternoon, as the squall line that eventually impacted all but a few far western local counties raced through South Central NE at an incredible average forward motion of 65-75 MPH. The squall line, which was still in its infant stages as it entered Harlan County out of Kansas shortly before 1 p.m., rapidly intensified/expanded in scope while reaching the Highway 281 corridor by 2 p.m., and then in the blink of an eye had all-but-exited the extreme eastern fringes of the local area (Highway 81 counties) by 3 p.m....wrapping up a brief-but-wild two hours of weather. As for the nine confirmed South Central NE tornadoes, they all occurred between 1:27-2:43 p.m. and had at-times-intermittent path lengths between 7-15 miles. The tornadoes concentrated within counties mainly situated between the Highway 92 and Highway 6 corridors, touching down as far west as eastern Kearney/Franklin counties and as far east-northeast as Hamilton/Polk counties. The circulations were firmly embedded within the aforementioned squall line, making these quasi linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes with often-intermittent damage paths. As is typical of such tornadoes, there was little in the way of clear cut photographic/video evidence, with the main exception consisting of a more classic looking photo of an EF-1 near Marquette. Although specific details regarding each of the nine tornadoes can be found in their respective event narratives, the vast majority of damage occurred to irrigation pivots, power poles/lines and a handful of outbuildings/grain bins, including a few fairly large metal outbuildings that were partially or completely demolished within only a few miles of communities such as Hastings, Marquette and Polk. Fortunately, no homes suffered major damage, although a few sustained relatively minor roof/siding issues. And although there were no reported injuries, one family north of Hastings had a fairly close call as their sport utility vehicle had several windows blown out of it only about one minute after they arrived home and sought shelter. Although straight-line thunderstorm winds along the surging line took a publicity backseat to the tornadoes, there were dozens of reported measured/estimated gusts of at least 60-70 MPH, and a handful of measured gusts as high as 75-85 MPH, highlighted by 85 MPH at Central Nebraska Regional Airport (official) and unofficial mesonet gusts of 84 MPH near Shickley, 83 MPH near Davenport and 81 MPH near Oxford. As just a sampling of damage attributed to convective winds: a blown-over semi truck on Highway 6 near Hastings; an overturned pickup truck and trailer along I-80 near Grand Island; significant roof and siding damage to a brick building in downtown Giltner; a metal outbuilding largely destroyed near Fullerton; a carport lofted into power lines in Bruning. Lastly in the convective department, hail was a minimal issue for the vast majority of South Central Nebraska. However, stones up to golf ball size significantly damaged a home near Marquette, while slightly smaller, wind-driven hail up to quarter size was reported in the Grand Island and Hastings areas, including a report of considerable damage to siding, fences and shingles in the Lake Hastings area.||Turning to non-convective severe winds, for the majority of South Central Nebraska they peaked in intensity a few hours after the passage of the squall line (and also impacted those few far western counties that were spared by convection), ramping up initially from the southwest and eventually west-northwest behind a surging composite cold front/dryline. Generally speaking, roughly the southwestern half of the local area observed its strongest non-convective winds between 2-7 p.m., while the northeastern half of the area peaked more so 4-9 p.m. However, the entire area endured at least a few hours of sustained speeds commonly 30-45 MPH and sporadic gusts of 50-70 MPH, including official peak gusts of 73 MPH at Hastings and Ord airports, and unofficial peak mesonet gusts of 77 MPH near Glenvil, 76 MPH near Davenport and 75 MPH near Norman. Although these non-convective winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convective winds, specific reports were actually quite limited. However, one unique highlight of these southwesterly-turning-westerly winds is that they shrouded much of the local area a under an eerie pall for a few hours during the mid-late afternoon...a combination of blowing dust (emanating off the western High Plains) and also smoke (from large wildfires in northern KS) that reduced visibility to under a mile in some spots. Fortunately, no wildfires were sparked within South Central NE itself, despite favorable conditions for large fire growth behind the dryline (especially in southwestern counties). The final severe-criteria gust of the evening (59 MPH) occurred in Nance County shortly after 7 p.m., and gusts eased down to only 30-40 MPH within most of South Central NE by 10 p.m.||The last weather element of this multi-faceted event (and ironically of least-overall impact for December) was snow, as far western/northwest portions of the local area observed roughly a one-hour period of wind-whipped snow between 3:30-5:30 p.m. as a weakening deformation zone on the backside of the system clipped parts of mainly Dawson, Sherman, Valley and far western Buffalo counties. Although total accumulations were mainly at-or-below one-half inch and there were no reports of significant travel impacts, the fact that this snow band prompted brief, greatly-reduced visibility reductions along Interstate 80 prompted the first-ever Snow Squall Warning issuance within South Central NE.||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots nosed into South Central NE from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center sliced across the heart of Nebraska from southwest-to-northeast during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the area. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to 500-1000 J/kg. Although somewhat modest instability values by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote robust severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields, with embedded QLCS tornadoes no surprise given 0-1 kilometer bulk shear around 40 knots and effective storm-relative helicity (SRH) around 200-300 m2/s2. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a 16-millibar gradient noted across South Central NE at 6 p.m. (ranging from 988 mb at Columbus to 1004 mb at McCook).||Closing with some comments about official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system. An area-wide High Wind Watch was issued early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was how great of a convective/tornado threat South Central NE would face, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a noticeable ramp-up of convective threat categories within South Central NE on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that barely brushed the far eastern fringes of the area with a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5), to the 1630Z outlook that correctly shifted Slight (level 2) and Enhanced (level 3) categories westward into several counties along/east of Highway 281.","This tornado touched down in northeast Hamilton County near Kronborg and moved northeast into southwest Polk County. This tornado was one of the more classic-looking tornadoes of the day, based on photos reviewed. The estimated maximum wind speed of 100 MPH was based primarily upon snapped power poles, but a hog facility was also heavily damages about 2 miles into the path of this tornado. The tornado crossed Highway 66 about two miles west of Polk. Just before it lifted north of Polk, the tornado took down a large metal building.",CSV

Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.  Along with tornadoes, several incidents of wind damage and minor flash flooding also occurred.","The tornado produced its first damage north of Bay, damaging storage and outbuildings. The tornado gradually strengthened and destroyed a farm tractor storage building along Highway 135 northwest of Lake City. The tornado possibly weakened slightly as it crossed the St. Francis River area, but re-strengthened as it approached Monette. Northern and northwestern portions of Monette suffered significant damage. Homes and retail facilities had their roofs partially or completely removed, and the roof of a nursing home partially collapsed. One fatality and at least 5 injuries occurred in the nursing home.

Simultaneously, one low moved along the front from central Indiana to central Lake Erie. Increased surface convergence along the front, ahead of the aforementioned low, allowed an ongoing cluster of multicell thunderstorms to persist northeastward as the storms encountered moderate MUCAPE and effective bulk shear, respectively, in northwest and north-central Ohio during the early to mid-afternoon. ||The surface front and associated horizontal wind shear were probably a rich source of surface-based vertical vorticity. Surface-based effective storm-relative helicity of 100 to about 150 meters squared per second squared and low mixed layer LCL heights near 750 meters AGL resided along the front. All these factors indicated a favorable environment for tornadoes. As the multicell storms paralleled the front, one cell managed to produce a tornado as its updraft ingested preexisting surface-based vertical vorticity, stretched the surface-based vertical vorticity to tornado-strength via low-level convergence, and then advected the vorticity upward.","This EF0 tornado had estimated maximum winds of 85 mph.

Only four other EF2 or stronger tornadoes have occurred in the state in the past 10 years.||On Wednesday afternoon, a tornado that peaked in intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph traveled northeast along a path through Anne Arundel County and the City of Annapolis. It not only snapped numerous trees, but also produced significant structural damage to homes, businesses, and a school. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, even though it tracked through a heavily populated area. Several eyewitnesses to the event reported getting the NWS Tornado Warning through their cell phone in advance, and sheltering in response to the warning.||From the NWS storm survey, the first damage noted, and recorded touchdown point was in Owensville, Maryland, in southern Anne Arundel County, near the intersection of Sudley Road and Owensville Road. This included a large limb from a tree top over Sudley Road and several portions of large cedar trees snapped along Owensville Road. The tornado moved northeast across rural southern Anne Arundel County before crossing Mill Swamp Road. Here, about a quarter of a mile east of the intersection with Dove Farm Road, dozens of trees and large branches were snapped and uprooted in a path from southwest to northeast as far as you could see in either direction from the road. While the dominant direction of the tree damage was being blown down to the north or northeast, there were trees downed in multiple directions, and many were topped.||The tornado intensified further as it moved into the South River Colony community. Dozens of trees were downed along the easternmost portions of Monarch Drive. Homes near the intersection of Monarch Drive and Red Admiral Court were particularly hard hit by some of the strongest winds of the entire tornado path. Several had significant portions of their roof damaged or removed, and one home in the middle of the track was unroofed entirely. One resident in this area reported seeing the tornado as it approached. The tornado then crossed South River Golf Links before moving into a campus of school buildings that includes South River High School and the Center of Applied Technology South. There it damaged the upper parts of the football field grandstands and concessions stand, damaged the roof, and caused cosmetic damage to some of the upper portions of the Center of Applied Technology South. The schools were left structurally sound, and the staff and some students that were there were able to shelter without injury.||The tornado crossed Central Avenue around 2:11 PM and moved into Edgewater. Here it crossed the communities of Woodland Beach, Londontowne, and Edgewater Park. Dozens of trees and large branches were snapped, and portions of 5 to 10 roofs were noted to have been damaged. One home near the intersection of Millstone Drive and Oakwood Road had only damaged roof trusses remaining of its roof.||The tornado crossed the South River and moved through western portions of the City of Annapolis at peak intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph at 2:20 PM. Several trees were snapped along the path as it crossed Aris T. Allen Boulevard just east of the Annapolis Harbour Center shopping area. It crossed Forest Drive at the intersection of Parole Street. Several homes there sustained roof damage, and one home was unroofed entirely. As it crossed the area near the intersection of West Street and Lee Street, the most substantial structural damage was noted. A large warehouse building had the winds enter the south side of the building and blow out a large portion of the west side cinder block wall. The roof with large metal trusses was largely removed. A fast food restaurant had its sign entirely removed from its post. Another commercial building had its roof removed, significant upper portions of the cinder block building removed, and its large commercial sign post blown over. A strip mall across the street had its windows blown out and flat roof damaged. All the telephone poles and attached wires along this stretch of West Street were downed. Another commercial building had its windows blown out. Several eyewitnesses saw the tornado as it passed.||Additional residential roof damage occurred as the tornado moved north over Bowman Court. From here, the tornado crossed into the community of Admiral Heights. Affected were areas along Halsey Road and adjacent Cedar Park Road. Here, the wind did not directly cause any structural damage, but about a dozen trees were snapped. That included one large, healthy tree about two and a half feet in diameter. The tornado crossed Weems Creek and Rowe Boulevard, and then snapped several trees along Riverview Avenue.||Finally, the tornado crossed US Route 50/301 a few hundred yards west of the Severn River Bridge, snapping trees on both sides of the highway. The final damage noted occurred at the end of Acorn Drive at the last residential property that sits on the shore of the Severn River. Several trees were snapped here. The tornado dissipated here, or as it crossed the Severn River. The survey team was not able to find any damage north of the Severn River, and video evidence from social media indicates the funnel dissipated here.",CSV

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.","This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado  widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores.

The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky.

A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.","This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell).  This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path.

The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The  foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment.

In Logan County, the supercell that had cycled down its tornado in eastern Todd County (but continued to produce wind damage northeast of Elkton) spun back up again soon after crossing the border into western Logan County. It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) intensity with a damage swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton Sharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 narrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the middle of the house. On the north side, a large dairy farm was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, a wide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a forest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north edge a well built home had its second floor two-thirds thrown off. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first floor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built log cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. The tornado then turned more ENE in the Buena Vista Rd area. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here along with several outbuildings on the property. A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled.",CSV

This resulted in unusually warm temperatures for a December day and the ingredients to produce a historic tornado outbreak and flash flooding. This included multiple long track tornadoes. Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.,"The National Weather Service in Louisville surveyed a tornadic supercell over the course of 6 days in Warren County which directly struck Bowling Green. The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.",CSV

The combination of blowing dust and wildfire smoke created near-apocalyptic scenes within parts of the area during the afternoon, firmly cementing this event in the history books. Above all else, the wildfires were the biggest story of the day locally, as three fairly large fires (and a few smaller ones) impacted primarily southern portions of Rooks/Osborne counties, cumulatively burning approximately 19,300 acres/30 square miles and sadly contributing to one fatality. The largest fire in southwestern Osborne County actually represented the northern fringes of the so-called Four Counties Fire that primarily impacted portions of Ellis/Russell counties just outside the local area (this fire as a whole consumed over 121,000 acres/190 square miles). Turning to the convection that preceded the big blazes, although North Central KS did not endure the blitz of quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) tornadoes that states to the north-northeast did, the local area nonetheless served as the initiation zone of what was ultimately classified a serial derecho given that a nearly continuous swath of damaging winds extended hundreds of miles northeastward into southeast MN/western WI...the first December derecho on record in the United States. Within this six-county area, peak thunderstorm wind gusts registered up to 80 MPH and the more impactful and longer lasting non-thunderstorm gusts were commonly 65-80 MPH, with unofficial mesonets clocking incredible 95+ MPH gusts in a few spots. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries from the fierce winds, despite countless instances of damage primarily to trees, outbuildings and power lines/poles. Aside from the wildfires, the primary (and more widespread) issue caused by the relentless non-convective winds was a transient wall of dense blowing dust (mainly emanating from the eastern CO/western KS area), with ground-truth reports from observers near Damar and also Phillipsburg confirming visibility down to one-quarter mile or less for up to a few hours. ||Breaking down event evolution/timing for the local area, first of all, even before convection flared up it was already an unusual/noteworthy December weather day given unseasonable warmth/humidity being pumped into the area on strong south winds. By late morning-early afternoon, southerly gusts were commonly 45-55 MPH as temperatures soared to near-record/record levels in the low-70s F, accompanied by dewpoints surging at least briefly into the 50s F. Early in the afternoon a few local mesonet stations even recorded marginally-severe gusts around 60 MPH from the pre-convective southerlies. This set the stage for a quick round of severe wind-producing convection, as a small line of showers and initially-weak thunderstorms that first got going in northwest KS rapidly intensified and expanded in north-south extent as it entered the local area into Phillips/Rooks counties between 12:30-1 p.m. Over the next couple hours, this severe squall line raced across the remainder of the six-county area at roughly 60 MPH, already clearing eastern Jewell/Mitchell counties by 2:30 p.m. Along the way, area mesonets clocked several gusts into the 60-75 MPH range, with isolated 80 MPH gusts noted in southern Phillips and southeastern Rooks counties. Specific damage reports were limited but included: tree damage in Mankato and Downs; a large tree blown down and roof damage to outbuilding in far southeastern Osborne County. There were no local reports of severe-criteria hail.  ||Unfortunately, even with the convective line departing stage-right from the area, the worst weather of the day was yet to come as incredibly-strong (and generally westerly) non-convective winds surged across North Central KS behind a composite dryline/cold front, peaking in intensity primarily 2-7 p.m. During this time sustained speeds commonly averaged 35-50 MPH with frequent gusts of 65-80 MPH, with unofficial peak mesonet gusts highlighted by an incredible 97 MPH in far northern Smith County and 95 MPH in southeastern Rooks County. Although these remarkable winds undoubtedly caused considerable minor damage and/or exacerbated damage already done by earlier convection, specific reports were actually quite limited beyond the aforementioned significantly-reduced visibility from blowing dust. No matter, the majority of attention quickly turned to the overall-most-significant events of the day in North Central KS...the rapidly spreading wildfires in Rooks/Osborne counties. Although fire ignition was largely attributed to downed power lines, and rapid fire spread was clearly driven by the phenomenal winds, area vegetation was also riper-than-usual for extreme fire growth thanks to a multiple-week stretch of very dry conditions. In fact, between Nov 1-Dec 15, the majority of the six-county area measured less than 0.15 of precipitation, making grasses/pastures very fire prone. Although more details regarding these Osborne/Rooks County wildfires can be found in their respective event narratives, several aspects of this event...including that they burned roughly 19,300 acres (cumulatively) within the two counties, killed hundreds of cattle, destroyed two homes and contributed to the death of an elderly man who inadvertently drove into the path of one of the fires...clearly cemented this as one of the worst wildfire events in North Central KS history. Although parts of the area continued to burn well into the night while blazes were gradually contained, thankfully west-northwest winds underwent a steady decrease through the evening, with severe-criteria gusts abating by around 7 p.m. and easing down to under 30 MPH by 9-10 p.m. ||Examining the meteorology behind this event, this would have been considered a powerhouse setup for severe convection/high winds during the more typical spring season usually associated with this type of system, let alone in mid-December. In the mid-upper levels, not only was the parent, negatively-tilted shortwave trough notably intense as it slammed across the central United States, but it was also notably fast. At daybreak, its vorticity maximum was just passing by the Four Corners, but by mid-day it had already reached the NE/CO/KS border area and by sunset had advanced into far northeast NE. At the 500-millibar level, a stout jet streak of 100+ knots lifted directly over North Central KS from the south-southwest during the afternoon, while lower in the column a very potent southerly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) ramped up to 40-60 knots before turning more westerly and intensifying to 60-80 knots. At the surface, a vigorous low pressure center tracked slightly north of the area across NE during the afternoon, deepening to around 984 millibars along the way and driving a sharp dryline/cold frontal combo eastward through the region. As mentioned, surface dewpoints climbed into the 50s F across much of the area prior to convective initiation, fostering a corridor of mixed-layer CAPE up to around 500 J/kg. Although only modest instability by warmer-season standards, in this case it was more than enough to promote severe convection in the presence of extreme wind fields. In the wake of the squall line, the ensuing and more notable non-convective wind event corresponded to a zone of deep subsidence (likely associated with a sting jet) and a pronounced surface pressure gradient on the backside of the departing low, with a nearly 10-millibar gradient transecting North Central KS from northeast-to-southwest at 5 p.m. (from around 990 mb at Hebron NE to around 1000 mb at Hill City KS). ||Closing with some comments regarding official NWS forecasts leading up to this historic event, there was excellent awareness several days in advance regarding the likelihood of powerful non-convective winds both ahead of (southerlies) and behind (westerlies) the intense surface low pressure system, along with an unusually-concerning fire weather threat. A High Wind Watch was issued for North Central KS early on the 13th (48-60 hours in advance) and was subsequently upgraded to a High Wind Warning early on the 14th. Meanwhile, a Fire Weather Watch was issued early on the 14th (36 hours in advance) and upgraded to a Red Flag Warning that afternoon. However, what was not as well anticipated (both at the local and national forecast level) was that the area would also face the threat of severe convection, as the fast-tracking squall line ended up forming slightly earlier and several counties farther west-southwest than most model data suggested (especially 12+ hours out). As a result, there was a late ramp-up of convective threat categories within North Central KS on Dec. 15th SPC Day 1 Outlooks, progressing from the initial 06Z outlook that kept any official severe risk altogether east of the local area, to the 1630Z outlook that at least shifted a sliver of Marginal (level 1) and Slight (level 2) categories westward into parts of (albeit not enough of) the area.","A pair of wind-driven wildfires affected southern portions of Rooks County. These fires started in the afternoon hours of the 15th, and while they were largely under control by the early morning of the 16th, small flare-ups were a concern for a few more days. The suspected cause of these fires was downed power lines due to strong winds, which gusted up to around 90 MPH at times. The larger fire in southwest parts of the county burned approximately 6,137 acres, scorching along a nearly 1 mile wide and 11 mile long path from approximately two miles south-southeast of Damar (along Highway 18) to three miles northwest of Plainville. Although the fire was contained before reaching Plainville, a fire truck was proactively staged at the local hospital, just in case. Meanwhile, in the southeast part of the county, a smaller fire consumed approximately 1,932 acres along a path running from around two miles north through five miles east of Codell. Though no homes were lost in these two fires, several older outbuildings and one oil rig were burned. In the wake of the fires, it was noted that the ground was scoured clean in some areas as the ferocious winds easily swept away soil where grass had burned away.",CSV

The entire area had gusts over 58 mph with the strongest speeds 75 to 100 MPH along and north of the Hwy 50 corridor. ||Due to the combination of intense non-thunderstorm winds of 75-100 mph, very dry air, unusually warm temperatures and low humidity, extremely critical fire weather conditions developed across parts of western and central Kansas during the day. ). Once fires started they exhibited extreme behavior, including rapid spread at more than 50 mph. This led to extreme fire weather growth and spread over the course of 6-8 hours during the late afternoon and evening. Per the Kansas Forest Service, total acreage burned across Kansas on December 15 was 163,755.9 acres, of which 67,500  acres burned in our area of responsibility. Unfortunately, these fires did result in a fatality in Ellis county.||Once the high winds of 75+ mph developed, widespread blowing dust was observed thanks to the very dry conditions over the previous month and a half.  At least one fatality was associated with a car accident in reduced visibility due to blowing dust in western Kansas.","A very large and fast moving wildfire burned nearly 50,000 acres.  Numerous structures, fence posts, livestock, wildlife were killed by the fire.  Fire officials indicated that structures that normally take 90 to 120 minutes to burn completely in high wind were burning to cinders in less than 15 minutes. Tragically one person caught in the fire passed away.  He was driving to a structure for protection from high wind and ran out of fuel and was caught in the advancing fire line.",CSV
