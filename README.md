# Final_Project 

For our final assessment we decided on Using NOAA Storm Events Dataset as test/train data. Our goal is to create a interactive database that allows the user to select a certain state, or city and view their former weather conditions. The information the database returns to the user is a ranking based previous weather patterns on how safe that area is to live in.

As a team we decided our dataset scope would be based on the quality of location data from 2006-2021. Each of us transformed a year inbetween the years 2006 and 2021 into a dataframe and performed exploratory analysis to get a better understanding with the data. 


Communication protocols:
We decided we would primarily use the scheduled class time for the bulk of creating our project. As well as slack anytime a team member has a question. If needed we will find time outside of class to host meetings.
