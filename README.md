## Data Exploration
For segment 1 we decided to explore the NOAA Storm Events Dataset for machine learning potential. Our goal is to create a interactive database that allows the user to select a certain state, or city and view their former weather conditions. The information the database returns to the user is a ranking based previous weather patterns on how safe that area is to live in.

As a team we decided our dataset scope would be based on the quality of location data from 2006-2021. Each of us transformed a year inbetween the years 2006 and 2021 into a dataframe and performed exploratory analysis to get a better understanding with the data.

## Communication protocols
We decided we would primarily use the scheduled class time for the bulk of creating our project. As well as slack anytime a team member has a question. If needed we will find time outside of class to host meetings.

## Machine learning component
This project will use the scikit learn machine learning library in Python for predictive data analysis.

## Database component
This project will utilize a Postgres type relational database  to be administered through the pdAdmin platform. It may be set up as an open source AWS database for accessbility reasons. The database will hold multiple source and result tabular datasets for the different project components. 


### Week 3 Deliverable

I fine tuned my dashboard on Tableau and did additional regression testing to better explain the dashboard I created. Our team has continuously been in contact through Slack to make sure every piece is ready to go on Wednesday. Here are some pictures of what I did this week.
